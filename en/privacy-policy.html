            is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
            Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to
            Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the
            following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

        <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
        <p>
            Among other things, tools of companies domiciled in the United States or
            other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU countries, are
            integrated into our website. If these tools are active, your personal data
            may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
            processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data
            protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed.
            For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data
            to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any
            litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled
            out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and
            permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no
            control over these processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>
            A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to
            your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have
            already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any
            data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object
            to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
            IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F)
            GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
            PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL
            BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA
            PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS
            YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT
            COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT
            OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE
            PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS
            (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
            ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED
            PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT
            ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER
            BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2)
            GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a
            complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where
            they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where
            the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect
            regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as
            legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically
            process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be
            handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
            format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
            controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
            content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
            website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the
            address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also
            by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be
            read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
            Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right
            to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their
            source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data.
            You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you
            have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about
            personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the
            processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us
            at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
            following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived
                by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the
                time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that
                we restrict the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful
                manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of
                your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>
                If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
                exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand
                the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its
                eradication.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights
                and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it
                has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
                demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data –
            with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to
            your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
            protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
            important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member
            state of the EU.

            The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your request
            is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out
            pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our
            legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to
            us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has

            of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no
            longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry).
            This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions, in
            particular retention periods.
        </p>
        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
        <p>
            If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all
            resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us
            for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on
            without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry

            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling
            of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your
            consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you
            request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for
            the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory
            statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain
            unaffected.

        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            This website uses functions of the web analysis service Google Analytics.
            The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon
            House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the behavior
            patterns of website visitors. To that end, the website operator receives a
            variety of user data, such as pages accessed, time spent on the page, the
            utilized operating system and the user’s origin. Google may consolidate
            these data in a profile that is allocated to the respective user or the
            user’s device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google Analytics uses technologies that make the recognition of the user for
            the purpose of analyzing the user behavior patterns (e.g., cookies or device
            fingerprinting). The website use information recorded by Google is, as a

            to optimize both, the services offered online and the operator’s advertising
            activities. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g., an
            agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively
            on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.

        <h3>YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
        <p>
            Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is
            Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4,
            Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube,
            this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information about visitors
            to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not
            necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled
            out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance,
            regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always
            establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.

            As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection
            to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the YouTube server
            will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged
            into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to
            directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have
            the option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to
            place various cookies on your device or comparable technologies for
            recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube will be able
            to obtain information about this website’s visitors. Among other things,
            this information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of
            improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to
            commit fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be
            triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond
            our control.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content
            in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate
            interest. If a corresponding agreement has been requested, the processing
            takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the agreement can
            be revoked at any time.

        <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website uses
            so-called Web Fonts provided by Google. When you access a page on our
            website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your browser
            cache to correctly display text and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection with
            Google’s servers. As a result, Google will learn that your IP address was
            used to access this website. The use of Google Web Fonts is based on Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in a uniform
            presentation of the font on the operator’s website. If a respective
            declaration of consent has been obtained (e.g., consent to the archiving of
            cookies), the data will be processed exclusively on the basis of Art.
            6(1)(a) GDPR. Any such consent may be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed on
            your computer will be used.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Google Maps</h3>
        <p>
            This website uses the mapping service Google Maps. The provider is Google
            Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            To enable the use of the Google Maps features, your IP address must be
            stored. As a rule, this information is transferred to one of Google’s
            servers in the United States, where it is archived. The operator of this
            website has no control over the data transfer. In case Google Maps has been
            activated, Google has the option to use Google web fonts for the purpose of
            the uniform depiction of fonts. When you access Google Maps, your browser
            will load the required web fonts into your browser cache, to correctly
            display text and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use Google Maps to present our online content in an appealing manner and
            to make the locations disclosed on our website easy to find. This
            constitutes a legitimate interest as defined in Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If a
            respective declaration of consent has been obtained, the data shall be
            processed exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. This declaration of
            consent may be revoked at any time.

        <h2>7. Custom Services</h2>
        <h3>Job Applications</h3>
        <p>
            We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job applications to us
            (e.g., via e-mail, via postal services on by submitting the online job
            application form). Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose and use of
            the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application
            process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use of your data
            will occur in compliance with the applicable data privacy rights and all
            other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as
            strictly confidential.
        </p>
        <h4>Scope and purpose of the collection of data</h4>
        <p>
            If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated
            personal data (e.g., contact and communications data, application documents,
            notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a
            decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship. The
            legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 New GDPR according to German
            Law (Negotiation of an Employment Relationship), Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (General
            Contract Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your consent – Art.
            6(1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke any consent given at any time. Within our
            company, your personal data will only be shared with individuals who are
            involved in the processing of your job application.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your job application should result in your recruitment, the data you have
            submitted will be archived on the grounds of § 26 New GDPR and Art. 6(1)(b)
            GDPR for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in our data
            processing system.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Archiving Period</h4>
        <p>
            If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job offer or
            withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have
            submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) for
            up to 6 months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or
            withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the
            physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in
            particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident
            that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g.,
            due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place
            when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article
            6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the
            deletion.
        </p>
        <h3>Our social media appearances</h3>
        <h4>Data processing through social networks</h4>
        <p>
            We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual
            social networks we use can be found below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can generally analyze your
            user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with
            integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or banner ads). When you
            visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing
            operations are triggered. In detail:
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media
            page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your
            user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be
            recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the
            respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for
            example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media
            portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests
            are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and
            outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the
            social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device
            you are logged in to or have logged in to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the
            social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing
            operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media
            portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the
            respective social media portals.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
        <p>
            Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on
            the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)
            lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be
            based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the
            social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
        </p>
        <h4>Responsibility and assertion of rights</h4>
        <p>
            If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together
            with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data
            processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle
            protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of
            processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as
            vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g.
            Facebook).
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media
            portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing
            operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the
            company policy of the respective provider.
        </p>
        <h4>Storage time</h4>
        <p>
            The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be
            deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your
            consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored
            cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory
            provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by
            the social network operators for their own purposes. For details, please
            contact the social network operators directly (e.g. in their privacy policy,
            see below).
